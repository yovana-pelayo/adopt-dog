# Supabase Dog Adoption App

Use [this template](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/half-baked-web-01-adopt-a-dog) for this deliverable.

## Learning Objectives

- Draw a simple architecture diagram describing the relationship between a user's computer and a single RESTful API.
- On load, use fetch and .then to hit a GET endpoint, get all items, and set state and update the view using the response.
- In front end apps with asynchronous behavior, use the network tab to examine (and debug) the request being sent to a server and the response received from a server.

Here is the model for the `dogs` table
